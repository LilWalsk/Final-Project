# Read Me
For this project we chose to measure the "best" neighborhood based on parking
My data set contained data from parking meters and the park mobile app. 
I based my data on the total number of transaction that went on in a zone, this is becasue the more transactions the more parking spots must be available. I was unable to use the time portion of the data set because it would only give me 10 minute increments and I wasnt able to decipher
for how long people paid.
By a large margin, South Side was the area with the most transactions. Therefore my data says southside is the best to park in.
